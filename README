# Assorted Tools

This GitHub contains a collection of classes and some standalong tools. Classes are designed to be imported into other python scripts (or have their code copied in).

# External Python Reqs

The following external libraries are required for at least one script in this repository:

* NumPy - https://pypi.org/project/numpy/
* https://pypi.org/project/pyrodigal/

# Classes

### agnostic_reader.py

Simple class that auto-detects zip status and properly reads both plain-text and gzipped files.

### progress_tracker.py

Class for tracking progress in a task. Given a count of items, prints up to (a default) 50 updates at every 2% completion. of the task.

Use: open the class with tracker = progress_tracker(total = ...) before a loop begins and add tracker.update() to the body of a loop.

### pyrodigal_importable.py

Class version of pyrodigal manager. Contains functions for reading a nucleotide sequence and predicting genes from within python using the pyrodigal tool (https://github.com/althonos/pyrodigal/tree/main/pyrodigal)

See main in pyrodigal_standalone.py in programs for usage help.

Warning: make sure you have pyrodigal version >= 0.7.2. There is a memory leak in earlier versions.

# Programs

### pyrodigal_standalone.py

Standalone, command-line program version wrapping pyrodigal. Pyrodigal is a python library that uses cython to access prodigal's C-language behaviors directly.

Pyrodigal is 30-50% faster than the original prodigal, so this script is intended as a (nearly) drop-in replacement for prodigal that simply offers better speed.
